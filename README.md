# FNB-AA-Week2-Khanyisile
Week 2 expands on the basic HTML learned in the first week, introducing CSS for styling web pages.
With the knowledge acquired in this lesson I built a Superhero App that uses images of superheroes and links to their bios. This project provides hands-on experience in combining HTML structure with CSS styling.
